- Clean the code a bit. Get rid of unnecessary lines.

- Do a recursive fill for the mass in case the type is a set (particle
  set). This will automatically take into account the cases where the
  child states are in an excited state. DONE (I think)


- Change the names from tree to binary tree. (treeDict => binTreeDict)
DONE

- Create a higher hierarchy tree, from which all the possible binary
  trees are created. So we can have all the possible solution trees
  and we don't leave out any solution due to groupping.

- Get the final masses also for the particle set. DONE

- Make a plot, and a gif of the CM line of two particles. DONE

- Solve completely a case with a binary tree.
